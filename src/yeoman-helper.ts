 *      2) prompting
 *      3) configuring
 *      4) default
 *      5) writing

 *      7) install
 *      8) end
 *
 * If a generator contains a method preceded by an underscore "_",
 * this method will not be automatically called.
 *
 * If a method does not start by "_" but does not match one of the previous
 * listed methods, it will be invoked between "configuring" and "writing",
 * in the default group.
